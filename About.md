## Hobbies and Interests

- Running: I have had a habit of running since college. Every weekend morning, I put on my sneakers and explore different trails and routes in the nearby parks, regardless of the weather or my mood. As a result, I have consistently improved my speed and stamina and never missed a chance to test my limits in marathon races. Furthermore, I appreciate the sense of achievement that comes from crossing the finish line. Through running, I not only strengthen and prepare my body for daily clinical work but also enhance my endurance.
- Trumpet: I have been playing the trumpet since high school. Every weekend night, I pick up my trumpet and sit inside a studio to practice my scales, arpeggios, and repertoire. Moreover, I participated in concerts, competitions, and festivals with school bands and orchestras on multiple occasions. Whenever performing on the trumpet, I forget the worries and get satisfaction from completing a piece of music. Through musical performance, I became familiar with the melody and story behind each masterpiece. I also learned the essence of craftsmanship because every music performer pursues perfection.
