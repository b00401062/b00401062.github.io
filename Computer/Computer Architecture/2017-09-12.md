- Classes of computers: personal computers, server, supercomputers, embedded computers, personal mobile device (PMD), cloud computing.
- Eight great ideas in computer architecture: Moore's Law, abstraction, common case fast, parallelism, pipelining, prediction, hierarchy of memories, dependability via redundancy.
- Levels of program code: high-level language, assembly language, and machine language.
	- __Instructions__: collections of bits that the computer understands and obeys, can be thought of as numbers.
	- __Compilers__ translates a program written in a high-level language into instructions that the hardware can execute.
	- __Assembler__ translates a symbolic version of an instruction into the binary version.
- Classic components of a computer: I/O devices, memory, and processor (datapath and control).
	- Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) use an __active matrix__ that has a tiny transistor switch at each pixel to precisely control current and make sharper images.
	-  The computer hardware support for graphics consists mainly of a __raster refresh buffer__, or __frame buffer__, to store the bit map.
	- The __datapath__ performs the arithmetic operations.
	- __Control__ tells the datapath, memory, and I/O devices what to do according to the wishes of the instructions of the program.
	- The __memory__ is built from __dynamic random access memory (DRAM)__ chips.
	- __Cache memory__, a small fast memory that acts as a buffer for the DRAM memory, is built from __static random access memory (SRAM)__, which is faster but less dense, and hence more expensive, than DRAM.
	- __Instruction set architecture__ is the interface between the hardware and the lowest-level software.
	- The combination of the basic instruction set and the operating system interface is called __application binary interface (ABI)__.
- A __transistor__ is simply an on/off switch controlled by electricity. The __integrated circuit (IC)__ combined dozens to hundreds of transistors into a single chip.
- The chip manufacturing process: ![The chip manufacturing process](https://github.com/b00401062/b00401062.github.io/blob/master/Computer/Computer%20Architecture/fig1-12.png?raw=true)
- The cost of an integrated circuit:
	- __Cost per die__ = cost per wafer / (dies per wafer &times; yield)
	- __Dies per wafer__ = wafer area / die area
	- __Yield__ &asymp; 1 / (1 + defects per area &times; die area / 2)<sup>2</sup>
- Two aspects of performance:
	- __Response time__ or __execution time__: the time between the start and completion of a task.
	- __Throughput__ or __bandwidth__: the total amount of work done in a given time.
	- Decreasing response time almost always improves throughput.
	- In many real computer systems, changing either execution time or throughput often affects the other.
	- __Performance__ = 1 / execution time
