- Four sources of packet delay: _processing delay_, _queueing delay_, _transmission delay_, _propagation delay_.
    - __Transmission delay__: packet length (bits) / link bandwidth (bps).
    - __Propagation delay__: length of physical link / propagation speed.
- Queueing delay grows _exponentially_ with traffic intensity $= La/R$, where $L$ is packet length (bits), $a$ is average packet arrival rate, $R$ is link bandwidth (bps).
- __Packet loss__ is due to packet arriving to full queue and dropped.
- __Bottleneck link__: link on end-end path that constrains end-end throughput.
- Internet protocol layers: _application_, _transport_, _network_, _link_ layers.
- Cyberattacks: (1) Malware: virus, worm, Trojan horse, spyware, botnet, etc, (2) denial-of-service (DoS), (3) packet sniffing, (4) IP spoofing, (5) record-and-playback.
- Application architectures: client-server, peer-to-peer (P2P), hybrid.
- In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes:
    - Client: the process that initiates the communication.
    - Server: the process that waits to be contacted to begin the session.
- Application layer protocol defines types of messages exchanged, message syntax, message semantics, and rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages. __Public-domain protocols__ are defined in RFCs, e.g. HTTP, SMTP, etc.
- __Socket__: the __application programming interface (API)__ between the application layer and the network layer.
- Transport services available to applications: _reliable data transfer_, _throughput_ (__bandwidth-sensitive__ v.s. __elastic__ applications), _timing_,  _security_.
- Requirements of selected network applications:

- __Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)__:
    - Provide connection-oriented service, reliable data transfer, flow control, congestion control.
    - Does _not_ provide minimum throughput guarantees, timing, and security.
- __Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)__: TCP-enhanced-with-SSL not only does everything that traditional TCP does but also provides critical process-to-process security services, including encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication.
- Popular Internet applications, their application-layer protocols, and their underlying transport protocols:
