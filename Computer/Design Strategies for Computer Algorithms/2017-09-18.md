- __Principle of optimality__: Any subpolicy of an optimum policy must itself be an optimum policy with regard to the initial and terminal states of the subpolicy (Bellman 1957).
- __Dynamic programming__: forward v.s. backward approach.
- If the principle of optimality does not hold, then dynamic programming may fail.
- Algorithms for variants of _shortest path problem_:
	- _Dijkstra's algorithm_: undirected/directed graph w/o negative edges.
	- _Bellman-Ford algorithm_: directed graph w/o negative cycles.
	- _Dynamic programming_: directed acyclic graph.
- __Optimal parenthesization problem__: Given a string of $n$ items, find an optimal parenthesization of the string. Can be applied to file merging and Huffman code grouping.
