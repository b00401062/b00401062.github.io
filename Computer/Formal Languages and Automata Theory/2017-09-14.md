- __Function__: for every $x ∈ X$, there is exactly one $y ∈ Y$ such that $(x,y) ∈ R$.
	- __Injective__ (__one-to-one__; $|X| ≤ |Y|$): for every $y ∈ Y$, there is at most one $x ∈ X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
	- __Surjective__ (__onto__; $|X| ≥ |Y|$): for every $y ∈ Y$, there is at least one $x ∈ X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
	- __Bijective__ (__one-to-one and onto__; $|X| = |Y|$): both injective and surjective.
- __Countable__: there is an injective function from $X$ to $\mathbb{N}$.
	- Examples of countably infinite sets: $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{N}$.
	- Examples of uncountably infinite sets: $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $2^\mathbb{N}$.
	- Proof of uncountability: __Cantor's diagonalization__.
- __Alphabet__ ($Σ$): a finite set of symbols.
- __Word__ ($w$): a finite sequence of symbols over $Σ$.
	- $ϵ$ (__empty word__): the word of length 0.
	- $Σ^n$: the set of all words of length $n$ over $Σ$.
	- $Σ^∗ = \cup_{n \ge 0} Σ^n$: the set of all finite words over $Σ$.
	- $Σ^+ = \cup_{n \ge 1} Σ^n = Σ^∗\backslash\{\epsilon\}$
- __Language__ ($L$): a subset of $Σ^∗$, i.e. $L \subseteq Σ^∗$.
	- Given two languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ over $Σ$, $L_1 L_2 = \{ w_1 w_2| w_1 \in L_1, w_2 \in L_2 \}$ (similar to Cartesian product).
- Other examples of countably infinite sets:
	- The set of all finite sequences over $Σ$, i.e. $Σ^∗$.
	- The set of all computer programs. $\because$ computer programs have (1) finite symbols, and (2) finite length.
- Other examples of uncountably infinite sets:
	- The set of all languages over $Σ$, i.e. $2^{Σ^∗}$.
- Question: For every language, we can write a computer program to detect it. (_False_)
