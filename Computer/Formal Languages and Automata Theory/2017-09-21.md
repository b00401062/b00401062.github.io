- Given two DFAs:
	- $A_1 = <\Sigma, Q_1, q_1, F_1, \delta_1>$ defined as follows: $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$, $Q_1 = \{q_{10}, q_{11}\}$, $q_1 = q_{10}$, $F_1 = \{q_{11}\}$, $\delta_1:Q_1\times\Sigma\to Q_1$.
	- $A_2 = <\Sigma, Q_2, q_2, F_2, \delta_2>$ defined as follows: $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$, $Q_2 = \{q_{20}, q_{21}, q_{22}\}$, $q_2 = q_{20}$, $F_2 = \{q_{20}\}$, $\delta_2:Q_2\times\Sigma\to Q_2$.
- The language of all words accepted by $A$ is denoted by $L(A)$
	- $L(A_1) = \{w|w\text{ has odd number of }a\}$
	- $L(A_2) = \{w|w\text{ has the number of }b\text{ divisible by 3}\}$
- __Theorem__: For every DFA $A = ⟨\Sigma, Q, q, F, \delta⟩$, there is a DFA $A'$ s.t. $L(A') = \Sigma^*-L(A)$.
	- This is an example of _closure under complement_.
	- $A' = ⟨\Sigma', Q', q', F', \delta'⟩$ is defined as follows: $\Sigma' = \Sigma$, $Q' = Q$, $q' = q$, $F' = Q - F$, $\delta' = \delta$.
	- $L(A_1') = \{w|w\text{ has even number of }a\}$
	- $L(A_2') = \{w|w\text{ has the number of }b\text{ not divisible by 3}\}$
- __Theorem__: For every DFA $A_1$ and $A_2$, there is a DFA $A$ s.t. $L(A') =  L(A_1) \cap L(A_2)$.
	- This is an example of _closure under intersection_.
	- $A' = ⟨\Sigma', Q', q', F', \delta'⟩$ is defined as follows: $Q = Q_1\times Q_2$, $q = (q_1,q_2)$, $F = F_1\times F_2$, $\delta: \delta((p_1,p_2),a) = (\delta(p_1,a),\delta(p_2,a))$
	- Proof: (1) $L(A) \supseteq L(A_1) \cap L(A_2)$ and (2) $L(A) \subseteq  L(A_1) \cap L(A_2)$
	- $L(A) = \{w|w\text{ has odd number of }a\text{ and the number of }b\text{ divisible by 3}\}$
- __Theorem__: For every DFA $A_1$ and $A_2$, there is a DFA $A$ s.t. $L(A') =  L(A_1) \cup L(A_2)$.
	- This is an example of _closure under union_.
	- $A' = ⟨\Sigma', Q', q', F', \delta'⟩$ is defined as follows: $Q = Q_1\times Q_2$, $q = (q_1,q_2)$, $F = F_1\times Q_2 \cup Q_1\times F_2$, $\delta: \delta((p_1,p_2),a) = (\delta(p_1,a),\delta(p_2,a))$
	- Proof: (1) $L(A) \supseteq  L(A_1) \cap L(A_2)$ and (2) $L(A) \subseteq  L(A_1) \cap L(A_2)$
	- $L(A) = \{w|w\text{ has odd number of }a\text{ or the number of }b\text{ divisible by 3}\}$
- __Regular language__:
	- Definition: A language $L$ is a __regular language__ iff there is a DFA $A$ s.t. $L(A) = L$
	- Closure under _complement_, _intersection_, and _union_.
- Conclusions:
	- The number of DFAs is countably infinite.
	- The number of languages is uncountably infinite.
	- Therefore, there is one language that cannot be represented by DFA, i.e. nonregular.
