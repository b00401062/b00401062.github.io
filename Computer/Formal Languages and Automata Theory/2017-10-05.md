- Definition: a language is __regular__ iff there is a DFA that accepts it.
- __Regular expressions__ over $Σ$ include (1) $∅$, (2) $ϵ$, (3) $a\inΣ$, (4) $e_1∪e_2$, (5) $e_1e_2$, (6) $e^*$.
- A regular expression $e$ over $Σ$ defines a language $L(e)$ as follows: (1) $L(∅) = ∅$, (2) $L(ϵ) = \{ϵ\}$, (3) $L(a) = \{a\}$, (4) $L(e_1∪ e_2) = L(e_1)∪L(e_2)$, (5) $L(e_1e_2) = L(e_1)L(e_2)$, (6) $L(e^*) = L(e)^*$
- Examples: (1) $L(e∪∅) = L(e)$, (2) $L(e∅) = ∅$, (3) $L(e∪ϵ) = L(e)∪\{ϵ\}$, (4) $L(eϵ) = L(e)$, (5) $L(∅^*) = \{ϵ\}$, (6) $L(ϵ^*) = \{ϵ\}$.
- DFA, NFA, and regular expression:
    - Equivalent in their descriptive power.
    - Closed under complement, union, intersection, concatenation, Kleene star.
- Theorem: For every regular expression $e$, there is an NFA $A$ s.t. $L(e) = L(A)$.
- $L(e) \subseteq L(A)$ proved by construction:

- $L(A) \subseteq L(e)$ proved by induction:
    - Definition: $A = \langle\Sigma, Q, q_0, F, \delta\rangle$, where $Q = \{q_0,q_1,q_2,...,q_m\}$.
    - Definition: $L(i,j,k) = \{w|$ there is a run from state $i$ to state $j$ passing only through state $\le k\}$, where $i,j,k\in\{0,1,2,...,m\}$.
    - _Hypothesis_: For any $k\in\{0,1,2,...,m\}$, there is a valid regular expression $e_{i,j,k}$ s.t. $L(i,j,k) = L(e_{i,j,k})$.
    - _Basis_: When $k=0$, $e_{i,j,0}$ is always a valid regular expression s.t. $L(i,j,0) = L(e_{i,j,0})$.
    - _Induction_: Assume the hypothesis hold for $k=m-1$ and consider $k=m$. $L(i,j,m) = L(i,j,m-1) \cup L(i,m,m-1)L(m,m,m-1)^*L(m,j,m-1) = L(e_{i,j,m-1}\cup e_{i,m,m-1}e_{m,m,m-1}^*e_{m,j,m-1})$.  Because $e_{i,j,m-1}$, $e_{i,m,m-1}$, $e_{m,m,m-1}$, and $e_{m,j,m-1}$ are all regular expressions, $e_{i,j,m} = e_{i,j,m-1}\cup e_{i,m,m-1}e_{m,m,m-1}^*e_{m,j,m-1}$ is also a valid regular expression.
    - _Conclusion_: $L(A)=\bigcup_{q_j\in F} L(0,j,k) = \bigcup_{q_j\in F} L(e_{0,j,k})$, and $\bigcup_{q_j\in F} e_{0,j,k}$ is the equivalent regular expression for any $k\in\{0,1,2,...,m\}$.
- Again, since the set of all languages is uncountably infinite, and the set of regular languages is countably infinite, there is a language which is _not_ regular.
- __Pumping lemma__ is a useful tool to prove languages that are _not_ regular.
- An example of proof using the _pumping lemma_: Prove $L=\{a^nb^n|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is _not_ regular.
    - Suppose $L$ is regular, and $A = \langle\Sigma, Q, q_0, F, \delta\rangle$, where $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$, is its DFA.
    - Consider the following word $w=a^kb^k$, where $k\ge|Q|$.
    - Then, $a^k$ can be divided into three part $a^k = a^ua^va^w$, and $k=u+v+w$ s.t. $a^u(a^v)^na^wb^k \in L(A)$ for every nonnegative integer $n \ge 0$.
    - However, there is a contradiction since $a^u(a^v)^na^wb^k = a^{u+nv+w}b^k \not\in L(A)$ for nonnegative integers $n \ne 1$.
    - Therefore, $L$ is _not_ regular.
