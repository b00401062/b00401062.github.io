- A CFG that accepts $w\in\{a^nb^n|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$: $G=\langle \Sigma,V,R,S\rangle$, where $\sigma=\{a,b\}$, $V=\{S\}$, $R=\{S\to aSb, S\to\epsilon\}$, and $S = S$.
- If a grammar can never be free from variables, then the language it generates is $\emptyset$.
- Theorem: CFLs are closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene star, but _not_ closed under intersection and complement.
- Given $G_1\langle\Sigma,V_1,R_1,S_1\rangle$, and $G_2\langle\Sigma,V_2,R_2,S_2\rangle$.
    - Construct the union of $G = G_1\cup G_2$ as follows: $\Sigma=\Sigma$, $V=V_1\cup V_2\cup \{S\}$, $R=R_1\cup R_2 \cup\{S\to S_1,S\to S_2\}$, $S=S$.
    - Construct the concatenation of $G = G_1G_2$ as follows: $\Sigma=\Sigma$, $V=V_1\cup V_2\cup \{S\}$, $R=R_1\cup R_2 \cup\{S\to S_1S_2\}$, $S=S$.
    - Construct the Kleene star of $G = G_1^*$ as follows: $\Sigma=\Sigma$, $V=V_1\cup V_2\cup \{S\}$, $R=R_1\cup R_2 \cup\{S\to SS_1, S\to\epsilon \}$, $S=S$.
- Suppose $L(G_1)=\{a^mb^mc^n|m,n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ and $L(G_2)=\{a^mb^nc^n|m,n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. The intersection of two languages $L(G_1\cap G_2) = \{a^mb^mc^m|m\in\mathbb{N}\}$, which is not context-free.
- Theorem: Every regular language is also CFL.
    - Given an NFA $A=\langle\Sigma,Q,q_0,F,\delta\rangle$, where $Q = \{q_0,q_1,q_2,...,q_m\}$. The equivalent CFG $G=\langle\Sigma,V,R,S\rangle$ is constructed as follows: $V = \{A_0,A_2,...,A_m\}$, $R = \{A_i\to aA_j|(q_i,a,a_j)\in\delta\}\cup\{A_i\to\epsilon|q_i\in F\}$, and $S=A_1$.
- Lemma: $L(A) \subseteq L(G)$ proved by induction.
    - _Hypothesis_: For every run of $A$ on $w=a_1a_2...a_n$ from $p_0$ to $p_n$: $p_0a_1p_1...a_np_n$, there is a derivation from $A_{p_0}$ to $a_1a_2...a_nA_{p_n}$. Therefore, if it is an accepting run, i.e. $p_n \in F$, then $A_{p_n}$ can be replaced with $\epsilon$, i.e. $w$ is derivable from $A_{p_0}$.
    - _Induction_ on $n$.
