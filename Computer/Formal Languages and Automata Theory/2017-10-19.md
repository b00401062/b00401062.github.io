- __Pumping lemma__ for CFL: Suppose $G$ is a CFG, and $w\in L(G)$ s.t. the depth to the derivation tree of $G$ on $w$ is $>|G|$, then $w$ can be partitioned into five parts $w=sxyzt$, where $|x|+|z|\ge1$, and $sx^nyz^nt\in L(G)$ for every $n\ge0$.
- __Pumping lemma__ for CFL: Suppose $M$ is the maximum of all the $|w|$'s that appear on the right hand side of the rules in $R$, i.e., $M=\max_{A\to w\in R} |w|$. Then, for every $u ∈ L(G)$ such that $|u| \ge M^{|R|} + 1$, $u$ can be partitioned into $u=sxyzt$, where $|x|+|z|\ge1$, and $sx^iyz^it ∈ L(G)$ for every $i\ge0$.
- _Pumping lemma_ is used to prove that a language is not context-free.
- Proof $L=\{a^nb^nc^n|n\ge0\}$ is not context-free:
    - Suppose $L$ is CFL. However, there is no a partition of $u=sxyzt$ s.t. $sx^iyz^it ∈ L(G)$ for every $i\ge0$, which is a contradiction.
    - Remark: $L=\{a^nb^mc^m|n,m\ge0\}$, $L=\{a^nb^nc^m|n,m\ge0\}$ are context-free. However, their intersection $L=\{a^nb^nc^n|n\ge0\}$ is _not_.
- A __push-down automaton (PDA)__ is a system $A = ⟨Σ, Γ, Q, q_0, F, δ⟩$ defined on $\Sigma$ the input alphabet, $\Gamma$ the stack alphabet, $Q$ a finite set of states, $q_0\in Q$ the initial state, $F\subseteq Q$ the set of final states, $\delta$ a set of transition functions: $(p,x,\text{pop}(y))\to(q,\text{push}(z))$, where $p,q\in Q$, $x\in\Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\}$, $y,z\in\Gamma\cup\{\epsilon\}$.
- Consider a PDA $A = ⟨Σ, Γ, Q, q_0, F, δ⟩$, where $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$, $\Gamma=\{a,b\}$, $Q=\{q_0\}$, $q_0$ is the initial state, $F=\{q_0\}$, and $\delta=\{ (q_0,a,\text{pop}(\epsilon))\to(q_0,\text{push}(a)), (q_0,b,\text{pop}(a))\to(q_0,\text{push}(b)) \}$. Test if $aaabba$ and $b$ are in $L(A)$.
- A __configuration__ of a PDA is a pair $(q,v) \in(Q\times\Gamma^*)$. A __run__ of a PDA on $w$ is $(q_0v_0)\vdash_{c_1}(q_1v_1)\vdash_{c_2}...\vdash(q_nv_n)$. It is an accepting run if $q_n\in F$.
- Given a PDA $A$, there is an integer $M$ s.t. for every word $w$, consider the run of $A$ on $w$, the stack always contains $\le M$ symbol. What is $L(A)$?
