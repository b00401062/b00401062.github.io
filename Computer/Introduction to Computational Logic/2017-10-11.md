- __Tseitin transformation__: For every propositional logic formula $φ$, there is a propositional logic formula $ψ$ in CNF s.t. $φ$ and $ψ$ are equisatisfiable.
    - For every non-atomic subformula $α$, define $C_α$ as follows:
    - Let $\psi= x_\phi  ∧ \bigwedge \{C_\alpha | \alpha$ is a non-atomic subformula of $\phi\}$. Then $\phi$ and $\psi$ are equisatisfiable.

- SAT algorithms: _backtracking-based_ v.s. _stochastic local search_ algorithms.
- __Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm__ (_backtracking-based_):
    - __Resolution__: $\frac{ϕ_1∨ψ\ ϕ_2∨¬ψ}{ϕ_1∨ϕ_2}$. $ϕ_1∨ϕ_2$ is called a __conflict-driven learned clause__.
    - __Non-chronological backtracking__: When a learned clause is generated, backtrack to the next-to-the-last variable in the clause to prevent the conflict from reoccurring.
    - __Unique implication point (UIP)__: Given a cut in an __implication graph__, an internal node causing a conflict is called a _UIP_ if it is one and the only one node in the same level as the conflict.
    - Emperically, the first UIP is the best.
- Examples of UIP. Cut 1: no UIP. Cut 2: $c_0$ is the UIP. Cut 3: $c_1$ is the UIP.

- Informally, a __predicate__ is a function from objects to truth values.
- Example: every student is younger than some instructor.
    - $S(x)$ means $x$ is a student; $I(y)$ means $y$ is an instructor; $Y(x,y)$ means $x$ is younger than $y$.
    - $∀x(S(x)  ⇒ (∃y(I(y)∧Y(x,y))))$
- Symbols in predicate logic: __predicate symbols__ $P$, __function symbols__ $F$, __constant symbols__ $C$.
- $C\subseteq F$: __0-arity__ (or __nullary__) function is in fact a constant.
- __Terms__: $t ∶∶= x∣c∣f(t,...,t)$, where $x$ is a variable, $c ∈ F$ a nullary function symbol, and $f ∈ F$.
- __Formulae__: $φ ∶∶= P(t_1,...,t_n) ∣ (¬φ) ∣ (φ∧φ) ∣ (φ∨φ) ∣ (φ ⇒ φ) ∣ (∀xφ) ∣ (∃xφ)$, where $x$ is a variable, $t_1,...,t_n$ are terms over $F$, and $P ∈ P$ is a predicate symbol of arity $n$.
- Free and bound variables:
    - __Free__ variables: An occurrence of $x$ in $φ$ is _free_ in $φ$ if it is a leaf node without ancestor nodes $∀x$ or $∃x$ in the parse tree of $φ$.
    - __Bound__ variables: Otherwise, the occurrence of $x$ is _bound_.
- __Substitution__ rules:
    - Variables can be replaced by terms (but not formulae).
    - Given a variable $x$, a term $t$ and a formula $φ$. Define $φ[t/x]$ to be the formula obtained by replacing each _free_ variable $x$ in $φ$ with $t$.
    - Let $t$ be a term, $x$ a variable, and $φ$ a formula. $t$ is _free for_ $x$ in $φ$ if no free $x$ in $φ$ occurs in the scope of $∀y$ or $∃y$ for any variable $y$ occurring in $t$.
    - Bound variables can always be renamed for substitution.
