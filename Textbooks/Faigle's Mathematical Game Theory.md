#  Faigle's Mathematical Game Theory

## Mathematical Models of the Real World

### Mathematical modelling

- A game involves *players* that perform actions which make a given system go through a sequence of states.
- There exists no practically feasible test for the continuity or the differentiability of a function!

### Mathematical preliminaries

-  Mathematical game theory can be developed in Hiblert spaces.
-  In a game-theoretic context, a probability is often a *subjective* evaluation of the likelihood for an event to occur.

### Systems

- A *system* is a physical, economic, or other entity that is in a certain state at any given moment.
- In a general *decision system* $G$, we are given a finite set of agents each of which is assumed to make a decision of a given type.
