#  Faigle's Mathematical Game Theory

## Mathematical Models of the Real World

### Mathematical modelling

- A game involves *players* that perform actions which make a given system go through a sequence of states.
- There exists no practically feasible test for the continuity or the differentiability of a function!

### Mathematical preliminaries

-  Mathematical game theory can be developed in Hiblert spaces.
-  In a game-theoretic context, a probability is often a *subjective* evaluation of the likelihood for an event to occur.

### Systems

- A *system* is a physical, economic, or other entity that is in a certain state at any given moment.
- In a general *decision system* $G$, we are given a finite set of agents each of which is assumed to make a decision of a given type.

### Games

- A game $Γ$ involves a set $N$ of agents (or players) and a system $S$ relative to which the game is played.
- The stage of $Γ$ at time $t$ is referred to as the associated sequence $γ_t = σ_0 σ_1 ··· σ_{t–1} σ_t$.
- The set of all possible stages after $t$ steps is denoted by $Γ_t$.
- A finite state sequences $γ$ in $S$ may not be feasible according to the rules of $Γ$ and, therefore, are not stages of $Γ$.
- When a game starts in a state $σ_0$ at time $t = 0$, it is often not clear in what stage $γ$ it will end (or whether it ends at all).
- A typical example of objectives is a family $U$ of utility functions.
- Utility functions which represent a gain are typically "concave".
- In a *profit* game the players are assumed to aim at maximizing their utility. In a *cost* game one tries to minimize one's utility to the best possible.
- A profit game with the utilities $u_i$ is formally equivalent to a cost game with utilities $c_i = –u_i$.
- A game with a set $n$ of players is a so-called $n$-person game.
- In the prisoner's dilemma, no matter what decisions are taken, at least one of the prisoners will feel that he has taken the wrong decision in the end.
