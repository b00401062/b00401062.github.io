## What Is Language?

### Linguistic Knowledge

- Even the simplest conversation requires profound knowledge that most speakers are unaware of.

### Knowledge of the Sound System

- Part of knowing a language means knowing its inventory of sounds.
- Knowing the sound system also means knowing which sound may start a word, end a word, and follow each other.

### Knowledge of Words

- Certain sequences of sounds signify certain concepts or **meanings**.
- The relationship between speech sounds and the meanings they represent is, for the most part, an arbitrary one.
- This **conventional** and arbitrary relationship between the **form** (sounds) and **meaning** (concept) of a word is also true in sign languages.
- In fact, many signs were originally like miming, where the relationship between form and meaning is not arbitrary.
- There is some **sound symbolism** in language.
- Most languages contain onomatopoeic words that imitate the sounds associated with the objects or actions they refer to.
- Sometimes particular sound combinations seem to relate to a particular concept.
