# Simpson's Forensic Medicine

## Principles of forensic practice

### Introduction

- Different countries have different legal systems because of culture, religion and politics.
- Those working within the medical, healthcare and scientific professions arebound by additional laws, rules, standards or regulations specific to their area of practice.

### Legal Systems

- The law is an expression of the formal institutionalization of the promulgation, adjudication and enforcement of rules.
- Criminal courts generally deal predominantly with disputes between the State and individual, and the civil courts with disputes between individuals.
- Decisions made by judges in the courts is referred to as **common law** or **case law**.

#### Criminal law

- Criminal law is that law which addresses the relationship between the state and the individual.
- Criminal trials involve offences that are 'against the public interest'.
- In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to prove their case to the jury or the magistrates 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

#### Civil law

- Civil law is concerned with the resolution of disputes between individuals.
- **Non-molestation order** instructs an individual not to contact, harass, threaten or be violent to another person.
- **Occupation order** prevents someone from, for example, living in or returning to the family home.
- The standard of proof in the civil setting is lower than that in the criminal setting.
- The penalty is designed to restore the position of the successful claimant to that which they had before the event.
- The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil cases and has three divisions: **Chancery**, **Family**, and **Queen's Bench**.

### Doctors and other healthcare professionals and the law

- Two roles in relation to the court, either as a professional witness or as an expert witness.
- The distinction between these roles may be blurred.
- In 1924, Dr Graham Grant, a police surgeon differentiated professional from expert witnesses in his book 'Practical Forensic Medicine'.

#### Professional witness

- A professional witness is one who gives factual evidence.
- This role is equivalent to a simple witness of an event.

#### Expert witness

- An expert witness is one who expresses an opinion about medical or scientific matters.
- Expert witnesses may also deliver **expert evidence** within the area of their expertise.
- Their testimony may be rebutted by testimony from other experts or by other evidence of facts.
- There are often situations of overlap between these professional and expert witness roles.
- The role of an expert witness should be to give an impartial and unbiased assessment or interpretation of the evidence.
- **Rule 702** held that proof that establishes scientific reliability of expert testimony must be produced before it can be admitted.
- If a witness is relying primarily on experience to reach an opinion, then that witness must explain how that specific experience leads to that particular opinion.
- The expert cannot just state his opinion, the expert has to justify it.
- The expert should be aware of relevant court decisions that relate to the expert's role within their own jurisdiction.
- The experts are being subjected to increasing scrutiny which have sometimes resulted in suspension or criticism.
- This area of law will continue to evolve.

### Statements and reports

#### Statements and reports

- A statement in a criminal case is a report that has a standard wording.
- The effect of this declaration is to render the individual liable for criminal prosecution if they have lied.
- A statement may be agreed by both defence and prosecution, negating the need for court attendance.
- A statement in official form or a sworn affidavit is commonly acceptable alone.

#### Attending court

- Most courts now have some form of witness liaison units.
- The court does have the power to compel attendance.
- A witness summons is a court order signed by a judge or other court official that must be obeyed.

#### Evidence in court

- The witness is liable for the penalties of perjury.
- The **examination in chief** and the witness will be asked to confirm the truth of the facts in their statement(s).
- During **cross-examination**, lawyers will have the opportunity to question the witness.
- During **re-examination**, the original lawyer has the opportunity to clarify anything that has been raised in cross-examination.
- The judge may ask questions at any time.

### Healthcare professionals as witnesses in court

- Any medicolegal report must be prepared and written with care.
- The dress and demeanour should be compatible with the role of an authoritative professional.
- The oath or affirmation should be taken in a clear voice that is loud enough to reach across the court room.
- The witness should always answer the question posed.
- A witness should also expect to have qualifications, experience and opinions challenged.
- A witness must be alert to attempts by lawyers to circumscribe answers unreasonably.

#### Preparation of medicolegal reports

- The diversity of uses of a report is reflected in the individuals or groups that may request one.
- Release of medical records requires the consent of the patient and, if at all possible, this should be given in writing to the doctor.
- There are exceptions, particularly where serious crime is involved.
- It is considered inappropriate for non-judicial state agencies to order a doctor to provide confidential information.

#### Content of a statement or report

- The basis of most reports and statements lies in the contemporaneous notes.
- When instructed to prepare an expert report always clarify whether or not a specific structure is required.
- A professional witness statement will be headed by specific legal wording.
- Clarity and simplicity of expression make the whole process simpler.
- The contemporaneous clinical notes may be required to support the statement.
- An autopsy report is confidential and should only be disclosed to the legal authority who commissioned the examination.
- Doctors must resist any attempt to change or delete any parts of their report by lawyers.

## The ethics of medical practice

### Introduction

- Medical and healthcare practice has many forms and can embrace many backgrounds and disciplines.

### Basis of medical ethics

- The Greek tradition of medical practice was epitomised by the Hippocratic School on the island of Kos.
- The Hippocratic Oath lay the foundation for what is broadly called 'medical ethics'.

### International codes of medicalÂ ethics

- **World Medical Association (WMA)** aims to establish and promote the highest possible standards of ethical behaviour and care by physicians.

### Duties of doctors and other healthcare professionals: UK perspective

- The General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK issues publications on how a registered medical practitioner (a doctor) should undertake good medical practice.
- The Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) is a body created by statute in England & Wales, which regulates healthcare professionals.

### Medical ethics in practice

- The formal role of ethics in contemporary health and social care has become much more clearly defined.
- The NHS Health Research Authority provides governance arrangements for research ethics committees.
- Medical ethics as a subject is incorporated into medical school curricula.
- There are very few medical or healthcare activities that do not have some ethical considerations.
- Although the spectrum of unethical conduct is wide, certain universally relevant subjects are recognised.

### Confidentiality

- Confidentiality and consent are the two primary duties.
- A number of permissible situations when confidentiality may not apply.
- Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

#### Disclosure of personal information

- Disclosures should be the minimum necessary for the purpose and follow all relevant legal requirements.
- Records should be kept of all decisions and actions.

#### Disclosures required by law

- Certain government agencies or bodies may have statutory power to access patients' records.

#### Disclosing information with consent

- Certain patients may wish to withhold particular aspects of personal information.
- Clinical situations such as medical emergencies may mean that information is passed without consent.

#### Disclosure requiring express consent

- Many important uses of patient information contribute to the overall delivery of health and social care.

#### Disclosure in the public interest

- There may be a public interest in disclosing information.
- It is always appropriate to seek advice in such circumstances.

#### Disclosures to protect the patient or others

- Disclosure without consent may be justified when others are at risk of serious harm or death.

#### Disclosure concerning patients without the capacity to consent

- It is expected that the doctor is seen to act in the patient's best interests.

#### Disclosure after death

- A duty of confidentiality continues after a patient has died.
- There may be situations when relevant information must be disclosed.

### Consent

- Treatment, investigation, or process must be freely given and not tainted by any degree of coercion or undue influence from others.

#### Patients with capacity to make decisions

- Consent is a key concept of healthcare.
- Previously the standard test to measure whether there has been a breach in their duty of care was
known as the **Bolam test**.
- In the UK the law on informed consent has changed following a Supreme Court judgement.
- Doctors must now ensure that patients are aware of any **material risks**.
- The **test of materiality** is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.
- In some settings written consent is mandatory.
- The responsibility for seeking consent is that of the doctor undertaking the investigation or treatment.
- Such a duty can be delegated if the person to whom it is delegated is appropriately trained and has appropriate knowledge of the treatment or investigation proposed.

#### Young people, children and consent

- Age is not necessarily a determining factor in the ability to consent.
- However, it is generally accepted that those aged 16 years and older have the capacity to make decisions about treatment or care.
- In the UK the GMC publishes guidance on making decisions.
- Reference is made in England & Wales to **Gillick competency** and the **Fraser guidelines**.
- Gillick competency and the Fraser guidelines refer to a legal case regarding contraception without parental consent.
- This test of competence is utilised in a number of other jurisdictions.

#### Patients without capacity to make decisions

- The doctor must engage with those who are close to the patient and with colleagues involved in the healthcare.
- In England & Wales decisions about those who lack capacity is governed by the **Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA)**.
- The MCA is intended to protect and empower people who may lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions about their care and treatment.
- It applies to people aged 16 and over.
- It covers a range of decisions about everyday living and more serous potentially life-changing decisions.
- The nature of capacity may vary dependent on the task.
- The MCA assumed that every person has the capacity to make a decision themselves, unless it is proved otherwise.
- The Act sets out a 2-stage test of capacity:
  - Does the person have an impairment of their mind or brain, whether as a result of an illness, or external factors such as alcohol or drug use?
  - Does the impairment mean the person is unable to make a specific decision when they need to?
- Mental capacity can also fluctuate with time.
- The determination of capacity is made by determining whether the person is ableÂ to *understand*, *retain* and *evaluate* the information, and *communicate* their decision.

### Regulation of doctors and other professionals

#### The General Medical Council

- In the UK, the regulatory body for registered medical practitioners (doctors) is the **General Medical Council (GMC)**.
- The GMC controls entry to the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (**the medical register**).
- The GMC has legal powers designed to maintain the standards the public have a right to expect of doctors.
- Before the GMC can stop or limit a doctor's right to practise medicine, it needs evidence of impaired fitness to practise.
- Doctors (and other healthcare professionals) in the UK have a 'professional duty of candour'.

#### Legal framework for GMC fitness to practise procedures

- Procedures are divided into two separate stages: **Investigation** and **Adjudication**.
- In the investigation stage cases are assessed to determine whether they need referral to the **Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service
(MPTS)** for adjudication.
- The adjudication stage consists of a hearing by a medical practitioner's tribunal.
- The **Fitness to Practise Panel** hears evidence and decides whether a doctor's fitness to practise is impaired.
- The GMC and appeal the MPTS's decision to the court.
- Doctors have a right of appeal to the High Court.

## Medicolegal aspects of death

### Introduction

#### Definition of death

- Death is not an event; it is a process in which cellular metabolic processes in different tissues and organs cease to function at different rates.
- This differential rate of cellular death results in substantial debate â from ethical, cultural, religious and moral perspectives â as to when âdeathâ actually occurs.

#### Cellular death

- **Cellular death** implies the cessation of respiration (the utilisation of oxygen) and the normal metabolic activity in the body tissues and cells.
-  Cessation of respiration is soon followed by autolysis and decay, which, if it affects the whole body, is unchallengeable evidence of true death.
- Skin and bone can remain metabolically active
and thus 'living' for many hours and their cells can be
successfully cultured days after somatic death.
- White blood cells are capable of movement for up to 12 hours after cardiac arrest.
- The concept of microscopic identification of a **vital reaction** to injury of doubtful reliability.
- The cortical neuron, on the other hand, dies after only 3â7 minutes of complete oxygen deprivation.

#### Somatic death and resuscitation

- **Somatic death** means that the individual will never again communicate or deliberately interact with the environment.
- The key element in this definition is 'irreversible'.
- There is no statutory definition of death in the United Kingdom.
- Brain-stem death would eventually result in respiratory arrest causing myocardial hypoxia and cardiac arrest.
- There is a spectrum of survival.

### Prolonged disorders of consciousness

- Disorders of consciousness (DOC) include: coma, vegetative state (VS), and minimally conscious state (MCS).
- VS may be judged to be 'permanent' 12  months after traumatic brain injury or 3 months after non-traumatic brain injury.
- **Human Rights Act 1998**: the 'right to life' and the right not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment.
- Legal permission from the **Court of Protection** is no longer needed to end life support for patients in a permanent VS.

### Tissue and organ transplantation

- There are very few countries where transplantation is expressly forbidden.
- Few religions forbid it â **Jehovah's Witnesses** are one such group.
- The **Human Tissue Authority** has issued guidance regarding the issues of consent for removal of organs for either research or transplantation under the **Human Tissue Act** where donors are deceased.
