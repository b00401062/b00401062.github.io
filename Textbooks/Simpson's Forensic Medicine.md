## Principles of forensic practice

### Introduction

- Different countries have different legal systems because of culture, religion and politics.
- Those working within the medical, healthcare and scientific professions arebound by additional laws, rules, standards or regulations specific to their area of practice.

### Legal Systems

- The law is an expression of the formal institutionalization of the promulgation, adjudication and enforcement of rules.
- Criminal courts generally deal predominantly with disputes between the State and individual, and the civil courts with disputes between individuals.
- Decisions made by judges in the courts is referred to as **common law** or **case law**.

#### Criminal law

- Criminal law is that law which addresses the relationship between the state and the individual.
- Criminal trials involve offences that are 'against the public interest'.
- In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to prove their case to the jury or the magistrates 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

#### Civil law

- Civil law is concerned with the resolution of disputes between individuals.
- **Non-molestation order** instructs an individual not to contact, harass, threaten or be violent to another person.
- **Occupation order** prevents someone from, for example, living in or returning to the family home.
- The standard of proof in the civil setting is lower than that in the criminal setting.
- The penalty is designed to restore the position of the successful claimant to that which they had before the event.
- The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil cases and has three divisions: **Chancery**, **Family**, and **Queen's Bench**.

### Doctors and other healthcare professionals and the law

- Two roles in relation to the court, either as a professional witness or as an expert witness.
- The distinction between these roles may be blurred.
- In 1924, Dr Graham Grant, a police surgeon differentiated professional from expert witnesses in his book 'Practical Forensic Medicine'.

#### Professional witness

- A professional witness is one who gives factual evidence.
- This role is equivalent to a simple witness of an event.

#### Expert witness

- An expert witness is one who expresses an opinion about medical or scientific matters.
- Expert witnesses may also deliver **expert evidence** within the area of their expertise.
- Their testimony may be rebutted by testimony from other experts or by other evidence of facts.
- There are often situations of overlap between these professional and expert witness roles.
- The role of an expert witness should be to give an impartial and unbiased assessment or interpretation of the evidence.
- **Rule 702** held that proof that establishes scientific reliability of expert testimony must be produced before it can be admitted.
- If a witness is relying primarily on experience to reach an opinion, then that witness must explain how that specific experience leads to that particular opinion.
- The expert cannot just state his opinion, the expert has to justify it.
- The expert should be aware of relevant court decisions that relate to the expert's role within their own jurisdiction.
- The experts are being subjected to increasing scrutiny which have sometimes resulted in suspension or criticism.
- This area of law will continue to evolve.
