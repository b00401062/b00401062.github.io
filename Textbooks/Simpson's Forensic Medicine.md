# Simpson's Forensic Medicine

## Principles of forensic practice

### Introduction

- Different countries have different legal systems because of culture, religion and politics.
- Those working within the medical, healthcare and scientific professions arebound by additional laws, rules, standards or regulations specific to their area of practice.

### Legal Systems

- The law is an expression of the formal institutionalization of the promulgation, adjudication and enforcement of rules.
- Criminal courts generally deal predominantly with disputes between the State and individual, and the civil courts with disputes between individuals.
- Decisions made by judges in the courts is referred to as **common law** or **case law**.

#### Criminal law

- Criminal law is that law which addresses the relationship between the state and the individual.
- Criminal trials involve offences that are 'against the public interest'.
- In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to prove their case to the jury or the magistrates 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

#### Civil law

- Civil law is concerned with the resolution of disputes between individuals.
- **Non-molestation order** instructs an individual not to contact, harass, threaten or be violent to another person.
- **Occupation order** prevents someone from, for example, living in or returning to the family home.
- The standard of proof in the civil setting is lower than that in the criminal setting.
- The penalty is designed to restore the position of the successful claimant to that which they had before the event.
- The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil cases and has three divisions: **Chancery**, **Family**, and **Queen's Bench**.

### Doctors and other healthcare professionals and the law

- Two roles in relation to the court, either as a professional witness or as an expert witness.
- The distinction between these roles may be blurred.
- In 1924, Dr Graham Grant, a police surgeon differentiated professional from expert witnesses in his book 'Practical Forensic Medicine'.

#### Professional witness

- A professional witness is one who gives factual evidence.
- This role is equivalent to a simple witness of an event.

#### Expert witness

- An expert witness is one who expresses an opinion about medical or scientific matters.
- Expert witnesses may also deliver **expert evidence** within the area of their expertise.
- Their testimony may be rebutted by testimony from other experts or by other evidence of facts.
- There are often situations of overlap between these professional and expert witness roles.
- The role of an expert witness should be to give an impartial and unbiased assessment or interpretation of the evidence.
- **Rule 702** held that proof that establishes scientific reliability of expert testimony must be produced before it can be admitted.
- If a witness is relying primarily on experience to reach an opinion, then that witness must explain how that specific experience leads to that particular opinion.
- The expert cannot just state his opinion, the expert has to justify it.
- The expert should be aware of relevant court decisions that relate to the expert's role within their own jurisdiction.
- The experts are being subjected to increasing scrutiny which have sometimes resulted in suspension or criticism.
- This area of law will continue to evolve.

### Statements and reports

#### Statements and reports

- A statement in a criminal case is a report that has a standard wording.
- The effect of this declaration is to render the individual liable for criminal prosecution if they have lied.
- A statement may be agreed by both defence and prosecution, negating the need for court attendance.
- A statement in official form or a sworn affidavit is commonly acceptable alone.

#### Attending court

- Most courts now have some form of witness liaison units.
- The court does have the power to compel attendance.
- A witness summons is a court order signed by a judge or other court official that must be obeyed.

#### Evidence in court

- The witness is liable for the penalties of perjury.
- The **examination in chief** and the witness will be asked to confirm the truth of the facts in their statement(s).
- During **cross-examination**, lawyers will have the opportunity to question the witness.
- During **re-examination**, the original lawyer has the opportunity to clarify anything that has been raised in cross-examination.
- The judge may ask questions at any time.

### Healthcare professionals as witnesses in court

- Any medicolegal report must be prepared and written with care.
- The dress and demeanour should be compatible with the role of an authoritative professional.
- The oath or affirmation should be taken in a clear voice that is loud enough to reach across the court room.
- The witness should always answer the question posed.
- A witness should also expect to have qualifications, experience and opinions challenged.
- A witness must be alert to attempts by lawyers to circumscribe answers unreasonably.

#### Preparation of medicolegal reports

- The diversity of uses of a report is reflected in the individuals or groups that may request one.
- Release of medical records requires the consent of the patient and, if at all possible, this should be given in writing to the doctor.
- There are exceptions, particularly where serious crime is involved.
- It is considered inappropriate for non-judicial state agencies to order a doctor to provide confidential information.

#### Content of a statement or report

- The basis of most reports and statements lies in the contemporaneous notes.
- When instructed to prepare an expert report always clarify whether or not a specific structure is required.
- A professional witness statement will be headed by specific legal wording.
- Clarity and simplicity of expression make the whole process simpler.
- The contemporaneous clinical notes may be required to support the statement.
- An autopsy report is confidential and should only be disclosed to the legal authority who commissioned the examination.
- Doctors must resist any attempt to change or delete any parts of their report by lawyers.
