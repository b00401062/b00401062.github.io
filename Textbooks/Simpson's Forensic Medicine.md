## Principles of forensic practice

### Introduction

- Different countries have different legal systems because of culture, religion and politics.
- Those working within the medical, healthcare and scientific professions arebound by additional laws, rules, standards or regulations specific to their area of practice.

### Legal Systems

- The law is an expression of the formal institutionalization of the promulgation, adjudication and enforcement of rules.
- Criminal courts generally deal predominantly with disputes between the State and individual, and the civil courts with disputes between individuals.
- Decisions made by judges in the courts is referred to as **common law** or **case law**.

#### Criminal law

- Criminal law is that law which addresses the relationship between the state and the individual.
- Criminal trials involve offences that are 'against the public interest'.
- In a criminal trial, it is for the prosecution to prove their case to the jury or the magistrates 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

#### Civil law

- Civil law is concerned with the resolution of disputes between individuals.
- **Non-molestation order** instructs an individual not to contact, harass, threaten or be violent to another person.
- **Occupation order** prevents someone from, for example, living in or returning to the family home.
- The standard of proof in the civil setting is lower than that in the criminal setting.
- The penalty is designed to restore the position of the successful claimant to that which they had before the event.
- The High Court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil cases and has three divisions: **Chancery**, **Family**, and **Queen's Bench**.
