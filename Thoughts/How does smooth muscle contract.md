# How does smooth muscle contract?

Smooth muscle contracts and relaxes in a completely different manner from striated muscle due to their microscopic structure and their distribution in the body. In the article, I will focus on the mechanism of smooth muscle contraction/relaxation.

First, I would like to make it clear what signals trigger the morphological change of smooth muscle. Generally speaking, there is no conscious control over it. The four things that control it are hormones, neurotransmitters, nitric oxide, and electric stimulus. Specifically, smooth muscle movement is controlled by the following first messengers:
- Contraction: Gq-protein coupled receptor (GqPCR) binding effectors, electric stimulus
- Relaxation: Gs-protein coupled receptor (GsPCR) binding effectors, nitric oxide (NO), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)

Smooth muscle movement pivots on the ratio of phosphorylated/dephosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC). When the ratio of phosphorylated MLC rises, smooth muscle contracts, otherwise, it relaxes. The enzyme that phosphorylates MLC is MLC kinase (MLCK), and the enzyme that dephosphorylates MLC is MLC phosphatase (MLCP). First messengers transduce the signal to second messengers, which then induces MLCK and MLCP to contract and relax smooth muscles, respectively.

GqPCR binding effectors. Examples are acetylcholine on the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors, catecholamine on the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, and histamine on the H1 receptor. There are yet tons of examples that can be appreciated on Wikipedia. On binding of effectors, the Gq protein alpha subunit detaches from GqPCR and finds phospholipase C (PLC) to activate it. PLC then converts PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 opens Ca channels on smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER), causing the influx of Ca into the cytoplasm and subsequent binding of Ca and calmodulin. The Ca-calmodulin complex activates MLCK, which in turn phosphorylates MLC.

Electric stimulus. When an electric signal travels down the cell membrane, L-type voltage-gated Ca channels are opened, causing the influx of Ca into the cytoplasm and subsequent binding of Ca and calmodulin. The Ca-calmodulin complex activates MLCK, which in turn phosphorylates MLC.

GsPCR binding effectors. Examples are catecholamine on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor and histamine on the H1 receptor. Other examples can be appreciated on Wikipedia. On binding of effectors, Gs protein alpha subunit detaches from GsPCR and finds adenylate cyclase to activate it. Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP, then, activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.

Nitric oxide (NO). NO diffuses across the cell membrane and finds guanylate cyclase to activate it. Guanylate cyclase converts GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP receptor is a class of receptor guanylate cyclase. On binding of ANP, the ANP receptor is linked to guanylate cyclase and activates it. Guanylate cyclase converts GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates MLCP, which in turn dephosphorylates MLC.
