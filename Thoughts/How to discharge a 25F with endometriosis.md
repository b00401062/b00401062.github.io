# How to discharge a 25F with endometriosis?

Dear Ms. Graham,

I am writing to inform you of Mrs. Fletcher, who was admitted on 25 Mar due to endometriosis and is now ready for discharge and will follow up with you for further care.

Mrs. Fletcher presented with a 3-year history of painful periods localized to the lower left quadrant and has had difficulty conceiving for a year. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a 6cm cyst, likely of endometrial origin. Therefore, a diagnosis of endometriosis was made, for which she received laparoscopic surgery without complication today. Postoperatively, she is recovering well, and laboratory values were all within normal limits.

Currently, she demonstrates good progress overall and is ready to be discharged today. She has been advised to keep the incisions clean and dry at all times and is permitted to start showering from 26 Mar. She is encouraged to ambulate, but driving should be prohibited until 24-48 hours after the final dose of analgesics. Also, sexual activity can be resumed 2 weeks postoperatively. She may resume her normal diet today and is encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. She is ready for discharge today and will follow up with you for postoperative monitoring and care.

I am truly grateful for the care that you can provide to Mrs. Fletcher. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
