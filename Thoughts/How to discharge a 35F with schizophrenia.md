# How to discharge a 35F with schizophrenia?

Dear Dr. DiCoccio,

I am writing to inform you of Ms. Tailor, a 35-year-old dependent on disability allowance, who admitted herself on 01 Mar with decompensated schizophrenia and will be discharged today and follow up with you for further care.

On admission, she experienced auditory and visual hallucinations, and delusions. She reported non-compliance with her medications. Examination revealed agitation and aggression with thought blocking and latency. Therefore, she was admitted and placed back on her antipsychotics. Meanwhile, her nursing management in the hospital focused on compliance with her antipsychotic medications, behavioral control, and therapy.

Currently, her symptoms have subsided since 10 Mar. She becomes able to focus on her activities of daily living. In addition, examination revealed significant improvement. Overall, she is in good progress and has fair insight and judgment. Her current medications include oral risperidone 4mg nightly, and additional oral risperidone can be administered as needed twice daily for agitation and psychosis. She will be discharged from the hospital to her apartment where she lives alone and follow up with you to continue her treatment of schizophrenia and avoid non-compliance with her medications.

I am truly grateful for the care that you can provide to Ms. Tailor. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
