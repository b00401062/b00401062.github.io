# How to discharge a 77F with AV block?

Dear Mr. Connolly,

I am writing to inform you of Mrs. Garber, a 77-year-old, who was admitted on 03 Jan for pacemaker placement surgery and is now ready to be discharged to your rehabilitation center for further rehabilitation.

Mrs. Garber initially presented with a sudden loss of consciousness of 5 minutes on 16 Dec 2021 and was diagnosed with bradycardia with progressive AV block. A decision was made to place a permanent pacemaker (PPM), which she underwent on 03 Jan without complications. Postoperatively, she has been recovering well. PPM setting and interrogation have been confirmed as per the cardiologist's order.

Currently, Mrs. Garber is stable and ready to be discharged to your rehabilitation center for further rehabilitation. I have encouraged adequate hydration. Daily monitoring of vitals and weekly creatinine levels are recommended. While she can self-care, she requires assistance with a new exercise regimen and should avoid activities that strain chest and upper arm muscles. She should also refrain from raising the affected arm above the shoulder. After she follows up with the cardiologist, she may return home with her husband.

I appreciate the care that you can provide to her. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
