# How to measure muscle strength?

Muscle strength is measured on a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being the weakest and 5 being the strongest. Muscle strength of 5 is normal for a healthy individual. There are three essential components in evaluating a patient's muscle strength: gravity, resistance, and range of motion (ROM). Below is a brief summary for each level of muscle strength:
- 0/5: no movement
- 1/5: no movement but with muscle contraction
- 2/5: movement when gravity eliminated
- 3/5: movement against gravity but not against resistance
- 4/5: movement against gravity and moderate resistance with limited ROM
- 5/5: movement against gravity and full resistance with full ROM

Let's imagine a clinical encounter where you are going to assess muscle strength of biceps brachii. The first question to ask your patient is always "Could you flex your elbow?" Based on if the patient can do so, the scenario is split into two parts.

If the patient is able to flex the elbow: Apply resistance on the forearm to pull it away from the patient and ask him/her "Don't let me pull." If the patient is able to fully resist the pull, the muscle strength is 5/5. If the patient is only able to resist a moderate pull, the muscle strength is 4/5. Otherwise, the patient is not able to resist any pull and the muscle strength is 3/5.

If the patient is not able to flex the elbow: Lift the patient's forearm up in front of his/her chest to fully eliminate the weight and ask him/her "Could you flex the elbow again?" If the patient is able to do so, the muscle strength is 2/5. Otherwise, observe if there is any muscle contraction. If there is any muscle contraction, the muscle strength is 1/5. Otherwise, the muscle strength is 0/5.
