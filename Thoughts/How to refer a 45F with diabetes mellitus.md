# How to refer a 45F with diabetes mellitus?

Dear Dr. Farquad,

I am writing to thank you for seeing Ms. Taborlin, a 45-year-old schoolteacher, who is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and will be referred to you for managing her diabetes.

Ms. Taborlin has a 38-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus. She endorses noncompliance with her insulin regimen, has a sedentary lifestyle, and smokes moderately. She was last hospitalized on 02 Apr 2018 due to DKA with a glucose level of 530 mmol/L. After treatment with IV fluids and insulin, she was discharged with her condition, including HbA1c, stabilized. She has also had several episodes of DKA in the past. 

Currently, her insulin regime includes 45 units of Lantus nightly and preprandial correctional scale Humalog with 12 units nutritional baseline. Nevertheless, her glucose is not optimally managed, and she reports ongoing noncompliance with the regimen. I have educated her on the necessity of glucose testing, insulin administration, and smoking cessation. Also, I have discussed microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes with her. I am also referring her to you for stricter glycemic control and a possible insulin pump.

I am truly grateful for the care that you can provide to Ms. Taborlin. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
