# How to refer a 45F with dysphagia?

Dear Dr. Roberts,

I am writing to thank you for seeing Ms. Hall, a 45-year-old female, who likely has gastro-esophageal reflux with a possible stricture and will be referred to you for further investigation and a definitive diagnosis. 

Ms. Hall complains of a 2-week history of difficulty in swallowing solid food. She also has concomitant epigastric pain radiating to the back at the level of T12. Meanwhile, she has lost 1-2 kg in a short period. She endorses a recent increase in caffeine consumption and occasional aspirin use. She has a remote history of dyspepsia back in 2012 and was once prescribed oral and topical corticosteroids for dermatitis in 2014. She is a non-smoker and a social drinker.

Currently, a provisional diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux with a possible stricture is made. I have advised Ms. Hall to reduce her coffee and alcohol intake and cease any OTC medications. In addition, I have prescribed Pantoprazole 40mg daily. I am also referring Ms. Hall to you for your opinion and endoscopy if required.

I am truly grateful for the care that you can provide to Ms. Hall. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
