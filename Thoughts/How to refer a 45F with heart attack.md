# How to refer a 45F with heart attack?

Dear Dr. Banerjee,

I am writing to thank you for seeing Ms. Bennet, a 45-year-old commercial lawyer, who was recently hospitalized due to a heart attack and will be referred to you for advice and a review of her medication.

Ms. Bennet first experienced a heart attack on 08 Feb at an airport after a long-haul flight, which required defibrillation during first aid. She was then admitted to Oakville General Hospital and underwent a balloon-expandable stent applied via the groin. She recovered well during hospitalization and was discharged home under her mother's care on 15 Feb. She was put on captopril 50mg twice daily and atorvastatin 80mg once daily.

Currently, Ms. Bennet complains of dizziness and light-headedness, headaches, and episodes of diarrhea, which are likely side effects of captopril. Because of the stress from the side effects, she has requested captopril discontinuation and is reluctant to start new medications. Also, she did not attend the cardiac rehabilitation sessions as scheduled. I have counseled her on lifestyle changes. I am also referring her to you for advice and a review of her medication.

I appreciate the care you can provide to Ms. Bennet. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours Sincerely,
