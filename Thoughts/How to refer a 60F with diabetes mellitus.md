# How to refer a 60F with diabetes mellitus?

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to thank you for seeing Mrs. Priya Sharma, a 60-year-old retired clerical worker, who is a type 2 diabetic and will be referred to you for further management of her sugar levels.

Mrs. Sharma was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes back in 1999 and has no other significant past history. The last eye check in Oct 2017 indicated no issues.

Three months ago, Mrs. Sharma noticed that her glucose levels became hard to control. Her medication included metformin 500mg 2x/day and glipizide 5mg 2x/morning. On examination, her blood pressure was 155/100. Physical examination indicated no abnormality. Therefore, on 29 Dec, I added candesartan 4mg 1x/morning. On 05 Jan, laboratory tests came back showing HbA1c 10% and cholesterol 6.2. Therefore, on 12 Jan, I increased the dose of metformin and glipizide and added atorvastatin.

Currently, Mrs. Sharma's regime includes metformin 750mg 2x/day, glipizide 5mg 2x/morning, and atorvastatin 20mg 1x/morning. Her home BP is now within range. Her cholesterol level has normalized to 3.2, but her fasting sugar is still in the 16+ range. I have discussed the laboratory reports with her. I am also referring her to you for further management of her sugar levels.

I appreciate the care you can provide to Mrs. Sharma. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,
