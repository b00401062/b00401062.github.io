# Is hydroelectricity always better?

While many scientists claim that hydroelectricity confers several advantages, the professor brought up concerns and potential harms of such an energy source. I will elaborate on those concerns in the following passages.

Firstly, the presence of a dam threatens the safety of the residents along the river. A vast amount of water flushes the land downstream of the river, which potentially destroys the integrity of residential houses. The residents are left with no choice but to leave their homes. Such an issue makes the use of hydroelectricity controversial since it sacrifices the residents' right to abode.

Second, the use of hydroelectricity also poses a long-term threat to the environment. Based on previous studies, toxic heavy metals are prone to deposit and accumulate in the river bottom. Moreover, building a dam alters the river's natural function. The river water dries up gradually and the water levels are subject to more intense fluctuation, which jeopardizes fishes that rely on a steady flow to survive. Overall speaking, hydroelectricity is detrimental to the natural habitat of local species.

Lastly, hydroelectricity is an unreliable energy source because it is contingent on rainfalls that vary across seasons. In addition, hydroelectricity is vulnerable to droughts during which no more electricity can be supplied. In contrast, fossil fuels are better at supplying stable electricity.

To sum up, hydroelectricity is neither convenient nor environment friendly as scientists used to believe. It does not only sacrifice the rights of the residents but also harms the local ecology and environment in the long run.
