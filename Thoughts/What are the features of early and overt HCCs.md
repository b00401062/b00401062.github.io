# What are the features of early and overt HCCs?

There are several techniques available for the diagnosis of HCC, from laboratory tests to imaging studies. For populations at higher risk of HCC, ultrasound is the only recommended screening test. Ultrasound is usually referred to as brightness-mode (or B-mode) ultrasound, but with the use of contrast, hyper-vascular lesions can be enhanced. When ultrasound is indeterminant, further imaging studies with dynamic CT/MRI are necessitated. With the administration of contrast, dynamic CT/MRI is capable of tissues of vascularity. A newer-generation contrast, called EOB-DTPA, can be taken up by normal hepatocytes and is useful for diagnosing early HCC. Also, levels of a few tumor markers, including AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA-II/DCP, help determine the degree of cancer progression and recurrence.

While early and overt HCCs are different in various ways, they both are not normal hepatocytes. As a result, HCCs manifest themselves as regions of distinct signal from the surrounding healthy liver. Furthermore, regardless of pathologic grades, HCC has a lower expression of transporters that are responsible for uptaking EOB. Therefore, HCCs appear hypointense in the hepatobiliary phase of dynamic EOB-MRI. Due to the high sensitivity and specificity of EOB-MRI in detecting HCCs, it is now considered the first line dynamic study for diagnosing nodules detected with ultrasound. Once the suspicion of HCCs is high, a liver biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Differentiating suspected nodules on imaging studies into early and overt HCCs guides further management. Before going into management, we will talk about features that tell early and overt HCCs apart.

## Early HCCs

- Blood supply: portal and arterial supply
- Non-pulsatile blood flow
- Hypovascular
- Fatty changes
- Usually < 3 cm
- Gross type: simple nodular
- Indistinct margin
- Hypoechoic on B-mode ultrasound
- Hypoattenuate on plain CT
- Isointense on MRI
- Slow "washout" in the venous phase

## Overt HCCs

- Blood supply: arterial supply
- Pulsatile arterial blood flow
- Hypervascular
- Usually > 3 cm
- Gross types:
- Simple nodular type with extranodular growth
- Confluent multinodular type
- Infiltrative type
- Irregular margin
- Hyperechoic on B-mode ultrasound
- Hyperattenuate on plain CT
- Hyperintense on MRI
- Fast "washout" in the venous phase
- "Nodule-in-nodule" appearance
- Mosaic pattern
- Basket pattern

Recognition of imaging features suspicious for early HCCs is crucial and allows early intervention. Everyone would agree that nodules with characteristic features of overt HCCs should be directed at treatment, while in the case of low-risk nodules, the timing for initiating treatment can be based on tumor size and growth speed. As a rule of thumb, nodules measuring ≥ 1 cm detected on ultrasound that exhibit an early enhancement pattern on dynamic CT/MRI without “washout” or those showing no early enhancement but measuring ≥ 1.5 cm should be biopsied or further studied with EOB-MRI for definitive diagnosis.
