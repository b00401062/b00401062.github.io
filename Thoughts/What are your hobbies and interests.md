# What are your hobbies and interests?

I develop a wide range of hobbies and interests through years of exploration. In fact, these activities not only bring about skills that are beneficial to my career but are also stress-relieving and essential for my well-being.

First of all, I have had a habit of running since college. Every weekend morning, I put on my sneakers and explore different trails and routes in the nearby parks, regardless of the weather or my mood. As a result, I have consistently improved my speed and stamina and never missed a chance to test my limits in marathon races. Furthermore, I appreciate the sense of achievement that comes from crossing the finish line. Through running, I not only strengthen and prepare my body for daily clinical work but also enhance my endurance.

Second, I have been playing the trumpet since high school. Every weekend night, I pick up my trumpet and sit inside a studio to practice my scales, arpeggios, and repertoire. Moreover, I participated in concerts, competitions, and festivals with school bands and orchestras on multiple occasions. Whenever performing on the trumpet, I forget the worries and get satisfaction from completing a piece of music. Through musical performance, I became familiar with the melody and story behind each masterpiece. I also learned the essence of craftsmanship because every music performer pursues perfection.

Overall, these hobbies not only relieve the stress in my everyday life but also boost my academic and work performance. Furthermore, I come to realize that persistence is the only way to excellence and success.
