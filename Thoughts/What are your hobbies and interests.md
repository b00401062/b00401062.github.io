# What are your hobbies and interests?

I develop a wide range of hobbies and interests through years of exploration. In fact, these activities not only bring about skills that are beneficial to my career but are also stress-relieving and essential for my well-being.

First of all, I have a habit of playing reversi on weekend nights. Moreover, annually, I participate in reversi tournaments, not just for the prizes, but also to enhance my playing skills. Through reversi, I become excelled at strategic thinking and have learned to apply the cognitive process to my everyday decision-making.

Second, I have been playing the trumpet since high school, and have performed with school bands and orchestras on multiple occasions. Through musical performance, I become familiar with the melody and story behind each masterpiece. I have also learned the essence of craftsmanship because every music performer pursues perfection.

Overall, these hobbies not only relieve the stress in my everyday life but also boost my academic and work performance. Furthermore, I come to realize that persistence is the only way to excellence and success.
