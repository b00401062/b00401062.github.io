# What do you like about cooking?

Cooking is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses the art and science of preparing food for human consumption. Given the expenditure of time and resources involved in cooking, it is essential to ascertain the rationale behind engaging in such an endeavor. Cooking confers various benefits to different individuals, but in my perspective, there are two advantages that I derive from cooking.

First of all, cooking enables control over the ingredients we use. Eating out or ordering takeout can expose us to poor hygiene and excessive amounts of food additives, which can harm our health in the long run or even cause immediate life-threatening poisoning. Therefore, by selecting fresh and clean ingredients from reliable sources and maintaining good sanitation in the kitchen, we can eat healthier and avoid diseases. For example, I always shop for certified vegetables and meat before I start cooking. Moreover, I make sure to wash them thoroughly and use only moderate amounts of oil and salt during cooking. These simple actions have helped me stay healthy so far. Simply put, cooking with care is beneficial for our health.

Another benefit of cooking is that it allows us to customize the flavors according to our preferences. We have all had unpleasant experiences of eating at a restaurant and finding the food too bland, too spicy, or too weird for our liking. On the contrary, a meal that suits our taste buds can make us happy and satisfied. Therefore, being able to adjust the seasoning is crucial for enjoying our food. As far as I am concerned, I like to cook with less salt and oil and bring out the natural aroma of the ingredients. I also enjoy adding some spice to stimulate my appetite and enhance the flavor. In short, cooking ourselves can ensure delicious and satisfying flavors.

In conclusion, I am fond of cooking because it gives me the freedom to choose natural ingredients and customize the flavors. I urge everyone to try cooking and see how it can improve your health and happiness.
