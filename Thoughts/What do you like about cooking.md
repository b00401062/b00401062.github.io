# What do you like about cooking?

Cooking is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses the art and science of preparing food for human consumption. Given the expenditure of time and resources involved in cooking, it is essential to ascertain the rationale behind engaging in such an endeavor. Cooking confers various benefits to different individuals, but in my perspective, there are two advantages that I derive from cooking.

First of all, cooking enables control over the ingredients we use. Eating out or ordering takeout can expose us to poor hygiene and excessive amounts of food additives, which can harm our health in the long run or even cause immediate life-threatening poisoning. Therefore, by selecting fresh and clean ingredients from reliable sources and maintaining good sanitation in the kitchen, we can eat healthier and avoid diseases. For example, I always shop for certified vegetables and meat before I start cooking. Moreover, I make sure to wash them thoroughly and use only moderate amounts of oil and salt during cooking. These simple actions have helped me stay healthy so far. Simply put, cooking with care is beneficial for our health.
