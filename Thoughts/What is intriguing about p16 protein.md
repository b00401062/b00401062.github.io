# What is intriguing about p16 protein?

p16 is a protein encoded by the CDKN2A gene, which has been recognized as a tumor suppressor gene. p16 plays an important role in slowing cell division by inhibiting a key enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). For the cell cycle to progress, the cyclin-CDK complex would activate several enzymes that are required for the next phase of the cell cycle once the level of the complex surpasses a threshold. By inhibiting CDK, p16 halts the progression of the cell cycle.

Although the functional role of p16 has been well studied, its association with disease occurrence and prognosis is not fully understood. What is intriguing about p16 is that its somehow contradictory effects on disease status. Both down-regulation and over-expression of p16 have been noted in certain diseases. I will illustrate the phenomenon with a few examples in the following paragraphs.

Homozygous deletions of p16 are implicated in several cancer diseases, including melanoma. The pathogenesis of homozygous deletions is well established. Non-functional p16 can no longer slow down the cell cycle and malignant transformation of aberrant cells. p16 deletion can be evidenced by IHC or FISH, but it is infrequently tested in practice since p16 deletion does neither facilitate diagnosis nor infer a different prognosis, and is not even a therapeutic target.

Interestingly, p16 expression is up-regulated in HPV infection probably because of feedback regulation that HPV turns on. Up-regulation of p16 could be thought of as an attempt to counteract proliferation induced by HPV infections. In clinical practice, strong p16 staining under a microscope is an indicator of HPV infection, which is implicated in various squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), including head and neck cancer and cervical cancer. Worth mentioning is that the absence of p16 staining does not exclude malignancy.

While HPV predisposes to malignant transformation of the squamous epithelium, p16-positive SCCs usually respond better to radiotherapy compared to p16-negative ones, making radiotherapy an essential treatment option for patients with p16-positive SCCs. 

In conclusion, p16 is implicated in multiple cancers with varying levels of expression. The pathogenesis is not all that clear and requires more investigation. Also, how over-expression of p16 contributes to a better prognosis in SCCs remains to be uncovered. We can expect to see more progress in the study of p16 in the future.
