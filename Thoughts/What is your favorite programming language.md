# What is your favorite programming language?

There are quite a few programming languages, either proprietary or open-source, for programmers to choose from. What programming language is most suitable for a beginner is always a pastime dispute among computer engineers. The reason we have that many choices out there is that each language has its irreplaceable niche in the market. From low- to high-level, from static- to dynamic-typing, from procedural to declarative languages, the combination of different features along the scale contributes to the diversity of programming languages.

Another crucial characteristic of a programming language is its capacity in handling errors/exceptions during the execution of a program, which can vary substantially in different languages. Also, the history of a programming language plays an important role in determining its own niche. A language can be regarded as more friendly to certain disciplines of computer programming.

Programming languages generally support arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, loops, functions, etc. Other advanced designs to simplify the codes and reduce the burden on programmers include class, lambda expressions, complex native data structures, etc. However, the logic of a program remains the same regardless of programming languages.

One misconception I would like to point out is that one programming language is more powerful than another. The fact is that every language can complete a job that another can do. Technically speaking, all eligible programming languages are Turing-complete. The programs written in different languages all run on the "Turing Machine", which is the common paradigm of modern computers.

Overall speaking, I think the choice of programming choice should not hinder our logical thinking. I personally use Java for programming most of the time. The reason I use Java is that it has been a mature and stable programming language since I started programming. It is not any fancy grammar or syntax that would force me to use any specific language. So, just feel free to pick any language and start programming!
