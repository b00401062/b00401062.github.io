# Why do you want to be a family physician?

During my medical school clerkship, I took pleasure in exploring the various specialties of medicine, contemplating several of them as possible career paths. Gradually, I began to recognize my inclination toward multiple areas of medicine and yearned for a profession that would amalgamate all of them. It dawned on me that a family physician would enable me to practice all facets of medicine due to their flexibility.

The versatility and diversity of family practice initially drew my interest. During my internship, I was fortunate enough to work with family physicians and family medicine residents in a variety of settings. I had the opportunity to observe their work not only during my core family medicine rotation but also in psychiatry, surgery, anesthesiology, and pediatrics. These rotations allowed me to see firsthand the versatility and diversity of family practice. I was impressed by the way family physicians were able to maintain a broad base of medical knowledge while also tailoring their practices to the needs of their communities and their own interests and areas of expertise. It became clear to me that family medicine offered a unique opportunity to combine my interests in different areas of medicine while still providing high-quality care to patients. These clinical experiences confirmed my belief that family medicine is a dynamic and exciting specialty that would allow me to make a meaningful impact on the health and well-being of my patients.

Moreover, I enjoyed my encounters with patients and their families during my family medicine rotation. I relished hearing patients' stories and sorting through their many medical and psychosocial issues. My joy in interacting with patients and my attention to detail help me formulate a complete story about a patient. I had the opportunity to treat terminally ill patients. It was an experience that left a deep impression on me. The emotional and physical toll of caring for patients who are at the end of their lives can be heavy. However, being able to provide comfort and support to these patients and their families during their final days is a profound privilege. The relationships formed during this time are often incredibly strong and meaningful, as the patients and families trust us to provide care and support during a time of great vulnerability. Despite the sadness and grief that often accompany these experiences, I feel grateful to have been a part of the journey of these patients and their families.

My desire to pursue a career in family medicine was solidified by my wonderful encounters with skilled and knowledgeable clinicians who were dedicated to improving patient care in various ways. These family physicians were not only clinicians but also teachers, researchers, and administrators. Attending continuing education lectures and courses was a priority for them to improve their clinical skills. They practiced patient-centered care and were well-informed about community resources available to their patients. Collaborating with other healthcare professionals to improve patient care was also an important aspect of their work. Notably, these physicians were approachable and friendly to both learners and patients. They also prioritized maintaining a healthy work-life balance and having many interests and hobbies outside their profession. These physicians exemplified the practice of family medicine, combining the science and art of medicine, advocating for patients, guiding them through the healthcare system, and focusing on maintaining their own health and happiness.

A deeper reason for pursuing family medicine is related to my childhood experience. As a native of a small city in Taiwan, I have personally witnessed the devastating effects of limited access to healthcare resources on my community. It is this realization that has motivated me to pursue family medicine, with the ultimate goal of addressing health inequity as a family physician. During my college years, I have actively sought out opportunities to learn from doctors working in rural areas and to engage in volunteer work, such as organizing a free clinic in the countryside. These experiences have filled me with a deep sense of purpose, as I have seen firsthand the positive impact that healthcare can have on people's lives. My aspiration is to become a compassionate and dedicated family physician who serves the underserved and helps to eliminate health disparities. I am particularly drawn to practicing in resource-deprived areas, where my skills and passion can make a real difference in people's lives.

As someone who is passionate about the potential of technology to improve healthcare and quality of life, I believe that family medicine has a critical role to play in this area. During a two-year hiatus from my postgraduate training, I worked at aetherAI, a software company that was focused on developing a digital pathology platform. Although my work was not directly related to family medicine, I gained valuable insights into the potential benefits of virtual healthcare and diagnostics for individuals living in remote areas. As a member of the aetherAI team, I participated in many discussions about how to make the services of pathologists more accessible to patients through our digital pathology platform. Through these experiences, I gained a deeper appreciation for how family medicine can leverage modern technology to enhance healthcare accessibility. This insight aligns perfectly with my career goals, and I am excited about the opportunities to integrate technology into family medicine to improve patient outcomes.

In conclusion, my passion for family medicine is rooted in its diverse and comprehensive approach to healthcare, the chance to build meaningful relationships with patients and their families, and the guidance provided by exemplary family physicians. However, what truly drives me towards family medicine is its potential to advance health equity and integrate modern technology. As I prepare for the next stage of my medical training, I am eager and excited to embark on a residency program in family medicine, where I can further cultivate my skills, knowledge, and passion for serving individuals and communities in need.
